## STEP 1: Install dependency: http-server

Run `npm install http-server -g` to install http-server globally.

Read more about http-server for node from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server


## STEP 2: Run the server

Once http-server is set up, you can run `http-server -c-1` to set up the server and `-c-1` is an option to disable caching since caching is on by default.

Open `localhost:8080`.

You can also change your port using `http-server -p 3001 -c-1` to change to port 3001.
