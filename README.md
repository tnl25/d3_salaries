D3 Exercise 1

STEP 1: Install http-server

Run `npm install http-server -g` to install http-server globally.

Read more about http-server for node from https://github.com/indexzero/http-server

STEP 2: Run the server

Once http-server is set up, you can run `http-server -c-1` to set up the server and `-c-1` is an option to disable caching since caching is on by default.

Run `localhost:8080`
